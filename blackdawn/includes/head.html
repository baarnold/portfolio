    <meta name="description" content="Blackdawn is a World of Warcraft Roleplay Guild on the Wyrmrest Accord (US) server.  The guild is centered on Jack of All Trades operations including black ops, transport, escort, and humanitarian duties.  Founded in March 2010, the guild enjoyed exceptional success on the original server of Earthen Ring, becoming the predominant and primary Gilnean and Worgen guild on the server, as well as boasting a diverse roster of every race on the Alliance. They also held or participated in many RP-PvE and RP-PvP events, maintaining cordial and cooperative relationships with many of our allies and nemeses.  Having transfered to Wyrmrest Accord in February 2016 due to record low player count on the older server, Blackdawn now strikes out to join the wider WrA community, seeking not only new members but also new allies and rivals to engage in both short, fun events and long, complex storylines.  This website is designed by the guild leader as a way to centralize the guild's information for both its members and outsiders for review and research, as well as provide a creative outlet for the guild members themselves.  With a new server comes new oppurtunities, and Blackdawn hopes to return to its former glory with a focus on quality over quantity, with a preference for a smaller, close-knit community rather than a large, nebulous one with no engagement or activity.  Headed by a duumvirate of the Guild Master and an Officer Council, the guild's primary focus is creating lasting friendships, engaging storylines, interesting and diverse characters, and exceptional hospitality and cooperation with the entire server community, red or blue.  If seeking out a new home, a new ally, or even a new rival with which to match up against, do come on in and see what Blackdawn has to offer.  We encourage any communication both in and out of game, and have a Discord for guild members and affiliates.">
