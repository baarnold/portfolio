					<h2 class="mk-4">Physical Appearance</h2>
					<p>Laraine Craston is a lean and diminutive woman; she could just as easily look at home in a library as she could on the battlefield.  
					Her hair is a snow-white coloration, pure and smooth without a single touch of grey; upon closer inspection, she's not as old as her 
					hair would make you believe.  Her petite frame shows no wrinkles of age yet, and her tanned skin, sunkissed by a life outdoors, 
					only adds to her particular brand of beauty.  Her hair is drawn back usually into a ponytail to stay out of the way, and her grey 
					eyes often flit about observing everything they can.  While she is not the most voluptuous or endowed of women, she preens and prides 
					herself on her figure -- lean musculature combined with small frame.  Her curves are not exaggerated, but are still pert, providing 
					her plenty of chances to show off for her spouse.</p>
					<p>She often wears tight-fitting or revealing armor, always in shades of purple and gold of the Kirin Tor of Dalaran.  Most often she 
					is found in a full-length skin-tight cloth body suit, with extra padding on the torso, and wraps on the arms and legs for additional 
					protection.  In order to keep herself somewhat modest in this attire, her tabard is generally far looser  to keep her 
					more alluring bits concealed, with a longer pelvic curtain in the front that flows down near 
					her ankles.  A consummate illusionist, she always has an air of magic about her, as something is almost always illusioned upon her, 
					usually some type of jewelry.</p>
					<h2 class="mk-4">Character History</h2>
					<p>Born Laraine M'Laine Sinclair, she was a member of the Sinclair Coven founded by her ancestors when they still resided in Gilneas 
					as "harvest" witches, before transitioning to "sea" witches after the founding of Kul Tiras.  Following familial tradition, the Sinclairs 
					have always taken the surname of the Witch, such as the case of her father Kendrick Sinclair (born Kendrick Seaworth). Following this 
					tradition, Laraine took the surname of her lover, Aviley Craston, the "female witch" she married.</p>
					<p>Laraine was raised as the third of four children, and the only daughter.  Her father was a veteran of the Second War, and came from a 
					long line of pirates, commandants, captains, and merchants.  Her brothers all followed the Seaworth bloodline in taking to the high seas: 
					Her eldest brother Roderic is a Commander in the Tirasian Fleet of House Proudmoore; her second eldest brother Dominic is a Captain and 
					smuggler in the Ashvane Trading Company of House Ashvane; and her youngest brother Frederic is a shipwright and mariner for House Stormsong. 
					Laraine was originally raised to take on the eventual matriarchal mantle of the Sinclair Coven, but during her adolescent years she applied 
					to and was accepted into the Academy of Dalaran, to train as a mage of the Kirin Tor, much to her mother and grandmother's annoyance.</p>
					<p>She trained specifically as a sorceress, learning and mastering conjuration, particularly those of illusions, as well as finding an 
					unfathomed control over the conjuration of water and ice, leading her to also master cryomancy before graduation.  After apprenticeship 
					she served as librarian, and part-time bodyguard and eye-candy, for Archmage Sirithil Nightstone until the War in Pandaria caused her to 
					be drafted into the role of a battlemage, where she flourished using her skills in ice magic and conjuration.  Eventually she would would 
					return to being a more permanent bodyguard assigned to Archmage Nightstone.  Lady Nightstone also employed a chronomancer, Aveliy Craston, 
					as her second bodyguard, who would immediately become infatuated with the alluring and beguiling Laraine.  After many failed 
					attempts at persuading Laraine to date, she eventually caved in and they began seeing one another regularly.  Unknown to Aveliy at the time, 
					Laraine was actually straight and had no interest in women.  However, after time and casual dating, this eventually blossomed into romance, 
					engagement, and marriage.</p>
					<p>No longer in Nighstone's employ (in part because neither woman were comfortable with Nightstone's advances on their partner), Laraine 
					now serves the Kirin Tor as a bodyguard for research and archaeological expeditions, often sent to protect (and keep tabs on) those done 
					by the Blood Elven members of the Kirin Tor under Aethas Sunreaver.  Having never lost her roots, she still takes ships for travel on 
					occasion, and still keeps Tirassian memorabilia such as a banner from her father's ships.</p>
