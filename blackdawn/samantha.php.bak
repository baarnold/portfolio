                    <h2 class="mk-4">Physical Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Inspite of her small statue, Samantha stands proud at her five-foot-three-inch height.  Through aid of dark healing magics, Samantha
					manages to keep her skin rather clear of blemishes and scars, even through her Undeath, though this unfortunately leaves her skin a 
					ghostly pale color that is quite thin in some places.  Her extremely light skin, however, is contrasted by her naturally dark lips, and 
					long black hair that frames her face well when it is not tied back into a ponytail for convenience.  Shining through the dark, illuminating 
					her ghostly feature are a set of glowing red orbs, emitting their blood red luminescence.  When facing combat or orders for training, 
					Samantha dawns a tight leather uniform in all black, almost impossible to see in darker locales, her hands covered with gloves bearing 
					a skeletal bone pattern, and a revolver strapped to her thigh, with plenty of room for other forms on weaponry to be tied to her for ease 
					of access, namely blades.  When out and about, however, she prefers a far more elegant attire of a simple black dress, dress shoes, and 
					pale white leggings to hide her skin.</p>

                    <h2 class="mk-4">Character History</h2>
                    <p>Undeath is a curse and a nightmare, and Samatha's life has not been too far from a waking one.  Watching her mother die before her own 
					eyes by the hand of her recently Scourged father at the mere age of nine, before the blade was turned on herself shortly thereafter, she was 
					denied the peace of death, instead forced to bear the curse that claimed her father, alongside her own mother.  Years of torment under the 
					Scourge would have to be endured, only calmed by the maddening whispers of the Old Gods that had sought to make her an agent of their 
					destruction, though in time.  With her freedom gained, and her mother lost once more, after the Battle for Light's Hope, Samantha would never 
					find a true home, bouncing from continent to continent, faction to faction, family to family, desperately searching for peace in her cursed 
					existence as she saw and committed countless horrors should she occasionally succumb to the influence of the Void.  After many years of 
					searching, she had finally found comfort within the Blackdawn, even being offered a position of apprentice to Alysdaire Blackdawn himself. 
					Freedom from her Void curse would be found at last, though at a price-- her youthful form had to be shed for that of a close friend, whom gave 
					her life in the process of saving Samantha an eternity of cold agony. Now she trains, fighting alongside her friends and new family in an 
					attempt to find her true place in Azeroth.</p>
