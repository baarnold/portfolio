				<div class="card-body">
				  <p>At the end of the Northgate Rebellion, Gilneas was in tatters - weak and wounded, the nation was now united under the Royal Banner once more, with many rebel leaders 
				  arrested, and many rebels forced to return to their lives living amongst their former foes.  Having fought on the side of the Royalists, Alysdaire's future was a bright 
				  one.  Tiberius was given a promotion and a handsome pension, and Alysdaire was offered to take up the mantle of his former instructors to assist in training replacement 
				  agents and officers lost during the rebellion.  On his way through the capital, Alysdaire was subjected to seeing the losses of the rebellion first hand: the homeless, 
				  the injured, and the orphaned.  Unable to face the people he was supposed to protect but had instead waged war against, Alysdaire took an early retirement and with the 
				  death of his father, used his inheritance to start a new organization - Blackdawn was Born, and it would protect those that were defenseless.</p>
				  <p>Joining Alysdaire would be his long-time friend and confidant, Ander Carmyne, who likewise wished to see the Royalist government care more for its citizenry than 
				  its nobles.  Also joining the group was Jaricho, a Gilnean mercenary they had befriended during the Rebellion who would act as the muscle for the fledgeling group.  
				  The trio set out to provide private security for more remote locations of Gilneas, particularly locations around the dangerous Blackwald.  In time others would join 
				  their organization, such as Tiberius's personal physician and alchemist Sershia Wolfthorn, the former Northgate Rebel 'Nyx' Forsythe, and Royalist sergeant and veteran 
				  Nicholas Vaelans.  Based out of Alysdaire's inherited manor in Duskhaven with a base of operation in Stormglen, the Blackdawn organization was small but well-liked by 
				  both rebel and royalist families.</p>
				  <p>Their work in the Blackwald soon started to increase in intensity, as murders started to occur both within the forest and along its borders.  Known as the Starlight 
				  Murders, Blackdawn was often hired by town mayors or small estates to protect themselves during the nights.  When Alysdaire's connections still remaining in the Gilnean 
				  Royal Services informed him of the long and secretive hunts the local nobility were performing in the Blackwald, hunting large beasts rather than spiders and foxes.  
				  During a few expeditions of their own, Blackdawn discovered these terrible beasts, and decided to capture one and determine what they were, where they came from, and 
				  to bring to light the darkness in the woods that the nobles seemed so keen to hide.</p>
				  <p>The stage was set - the entirety of Blackdawn would split in three parties to hunt and bag one of these beasts.  It was Alysdaire's group that found their quarry first, 
				  as such suffered the worst casualties in their attempt to capture the beast.  By the time reinforcements arrived, Alysdaire's group had been half-slain.  Jaricho, in his 
				  heavy armor, wrestled the beast before Ander struck the killing blow.  They then rushed the injured back to Stormglen, where Alysdaire was treated by Sershia with bandages 
				  and salves.  The group rested in the night and posted a guard on Alysdaire's room to ensure their injured leader would not be disturbed.</p>
				  <p>In the middle of the night screams were heard and soon enough a monster covered in bandages and blood burst from the building, attacking the guard and rousing 
				  the rest.  Given the bandages, attire, and injuries on the beast Ander and Jaricho were able to determine that the beast was in fact Alysdaire himself, and at great risk to 
				  themselves they captured and caged the leader.  Sershia then spent her entire collective efforts to determine the cause of the curse and attempt to return the man to his 
				  former self.  After months of testing with different doses and concoctions, the alchemist was able to subdue the beast and return Alysdaire's humanity, though the potions 
				  were far inferior to those that were later developed by Krennan Aranas and needed to be ingested constantly through the day.</p>
				  <p>Desperate for a cure and suffering crushing depression for the deaths caused at his own hands, Alysdaire enlisted Ander's assistance in pirating a ship out of Gilneas, 
				  bringing Sershia along with him in order to keep his bestial nature under control.  Ander was left in charge of Blackdawn, using their knowledge of the wolfbeast curse to 
				  prepare for the worst, and set up protection for their homes in Stormglen and Duskhaven.  Alysdaire posed as a Gilnean expatriate nobleman in Stormwind to gain influence 
				  and work towards securing assistance for his curse. The other Blackdawns were not so lucky, as the Worgen Curse had begun to spread and the Worgen were leading raids and invasions 
				  of Gilneas.  Soon a majority of the Blackdawns were infected, and in time with the assistance of Krennan Aranas and the royal alchemists, were returned to their humanity in 
				  far more complete manner than Alysdaire was.  While the Blackdawns had suffered in the absence of their leader, Ander had kept them intact with minimal, but still tragic, 
				  losses.  The worst was still yet to come, however...</p>

				<div class="card-body">
				  <p>Prior to the Invasion of Gilneas and the Cataclysm of Azeroth, Blackdawn had essentially been split into two separate organizations.  One based inside of the Greymane Wall 
				  and lead by Ander Carmyne, and the other based in Stormwind under Alysdaire Blackdawn, who had pirated out of Gilneas for a number of reasons.  Alysdaire had posed as an 
				  expatriate Gilnean Nobleman and earned the patronage of Archmage Sirithil Nightstone, and Lord Kalren Geroux who was vassal to fellow Gilnean expatriate Baron Decimus Monroe.  He 
				  used these connections to further the influence of Blackdawn abroad, with intentions to create a second branch of Blackdawn that would provide a safe and stable home for 
				  all of Blackdawn in time to escape the growing Worgen Threat he had left behind.  Unbeknownst to Alysdaire, many of the original Blackdawns had already been infected, and were 
				  being rounded up by uninfected Blackdawn-led hunts to have them treated by Krennan Aranas.</p>
				  <p>Alysdaire's efforts came to particular fruition when he became aligned with Calithos Blyde of Silverpine, a former Scarlet Inquisitor with plans for an Alliance-lead 
				  reconquista of Lordaeron.  With Commander Taldrus Dawnfield and Justicar Arialynn Maewood leading a major Alliance force into Andorhal, Alysdaire's Blackdawns helped to provide 
				  reconnaisance and subterfuge services in exchange for a permanent base on Fenris Isle to fortify in the coming war.  Shortly after relocating to Fenris Isle, however, the Forsaken 
				  Invasion of Gilneas had begun, and soon the Cataclysm itself rocked the planet, devastating many areas.  As the Reconquista refocused to holding Andorhal and sending reinforcements 
				  to halt Kalimdor offensives by the Horde, Alysdaire remained in Silverpine to lend military assistance to the Gilnean Liberation Front.  Recommissioned as a Commander in the 
				  Gilnean Military due to his position and connections with the Alliance already, Alysdaire's Blackdawns assisted primarily in surgical strikes on Forsaken supply lines and 
				  evacuating civilians from Silverpine, Hillsbrad, and Gilneas.</p>
				  <p>Simultaneously, Ander's Blackdawns were fighting fiercely against the Forsaken Invasion, joining with Rebel and Royalist forces alike to stem the invasion and turn it back.  
				  Though a number of original Blackdawns were slain, Ander's team were able to ensure the cremation of many graves to prevent the dead from raising from Forsaken efforts, including 
				  assisting in surgical strikes in the Blackwald.  Ander specifically assisted in saving what he could from their headquarters in both Duskhaven before it sank and Stormglen before 
				  it was abandoned.  Ander's Blackdawns assisted in sabotaguing Forsaken machinery, and assisted evacuating many Gilneans to the Kaldorei boats, staying behind as a 
				  rearguard.  They joined up with Lord Darius Crowley's Gilnean Liberation Forces, and during the outward push they met up with Alysdaire's Blackdawns and were able to consolidate 
				  their numbers and set up an evacuation route to Fenris Isle, where mages assisted with teleportations around the clock to Stormwind.  Those that did not accept Lord Darius Crowley's 
				  call to arms and offering of the Worgen Curse via blood rituals were handed to Blackdawn's protection to evacuate safely.</p>
				  <p>Throughout the Cataclysm, Blackdawn's forces operated in Silverpine out of Fenris Ilse, providing reconnaisance, subterfuge, espionage, and sabotage against Forsaken forces 
				  in service to the Alliance, with many Blackdawns serving in both the Battle of Gilneas and Arathi Highlands.  Baron Decimus Monroe's forces, the Phantom Legion, marched to Dun Garok 
				  to establish a bulwark against further Forsaken incursions, and as such the two organizations often worked in conjunction with one another at first.  Eventually Alysdaire would find 
				  Monroe's methods of Total War against both military and civilian targets to go a touch far, including making monuments of dead men, women, and children from their assaults.  As such, 
				  Blackdawn would also have its Black Operations unit, then known as the Pathfinders, to disrupt the Phantom Legion's efforts, while Alysdaire himself took to the political battles in 
				  Stormwind and the Alliance Military (via his Gilnean military commission) to stymie Monroe's influence and attempts at further resources, funding, or authority.  This eventually came 
				  to a head when the Phantom Legion forcibly kidnapped an ally of Blackdawn from a Stormwind Guard prison to inact their own harsh punishment against her.  Aided by Taldrus Dawnfield, 
				  Simayi Wolfwood, Calithos Blyde, and many others, Alysdaire's forces joined others to essentially lay siege to The Phantom Legion's Alliance-owned barracks.  Eventually, Alysdaire's 
				  forces used Seaforium explosives to detonate the Phantom Legion armory, resulting in many injuries, the ruination of the keep, and forcing the Phantom Legion to retreat, leaving behind 
				  their prisoner.  From this point forward, Blackdawn was known as a force that put the well-being of their kin over the political allegiances to their fellow Gilneans, a trend that would 
				  earn them both respect and ire moving forward, and affect their relationships with many.</p>

				  <p>Due to the unsanctioned assault on an Alliance Keep, those who participated were reprimanded, including Alysdaire Blackdawn, who had his rank suspended for one year at least, to be 
				  reinstated when requested and reviewed by the Grand Marshals Corran Ravencrest and Acele Walkinson.  Blackdawn at that time no longer had the authority or support of the Alliance High 
				  Command to operate as a military entity, and had broken the trust of a number of Gilnean patriots they had been aligned with for so long for their solo operations.  Hamstrung when it 
				  came to combat operations, the Blackdawn Organization was listless until the intervention of Alysdaire's newlywed wife, Reigan Ashford.  With her connections to Vice-Admiral Morgan 
				  Ashford, and her own humanitarian ideals, the organization took on new life by providing humanitarian assistance, including supplies, medical and food aid, evacuations, and even para-
				  military defense for Alliance outposts against external threats.  The Blackdawn Pathfinders, headed by Nyx Forsythe and Thaldred Kane, became an instrumental specialist mercenary force 
				  that could provide security or patrol details for various forces and organizations.  It was not until the Pandaria Campaign that Alysdaire would regain his military commission, being 
				  attached to the SI:7 mission for the White Rook as a member of a multi-factional force serving under Admiral Taylor.</p>
				  <p>Alysdaire served the stranded Alliance forces as a logistician, helping to maintain supply lines and scrounge up supplies to last them until reinforcements arrived.  Blackdawn arrived 
				  in the second wave that landed at Krasarang, and essentially they continued to serve under supervision from Commander Taldrus Dawnfield, per commands from Grand Marshal Acele Walkinson to 
				  keep an eye on their work.  Blackdawn also assisted Commander Dawnfield's joint assault up the Dustwallow Marsh to the Barrens to set up a foothold to overthrow Garrosh Hellscream when the 
				  Darkspear Rebellion began.  Due to Blackdawn's merchant work to fund their operations, they were offered Alcaz Isle to use as a supply port for Alliance and Horde efforts, building up a 
				  small yet fortified port, providing safe harborage for a Thalassian Fleet aligned with Vice Admiral Morgan Ashford's Alliance Fleet.  After Garosh's imprisonment, Blackdawn would remain on 
				  Alcaz for nearly a year, as they did not participate in the War on Draenor.  During this time, Blackdawn would suffer the loss of its humanitarian matron, as Reigan Ashford died from 
				  complications of child birth.  Since then, Alysdaire has taken steps to maintain the humanitarian focus of the organization, the memory of his late wife haunting him on many of his decisions.</p>
				  <p>Following a soul-searching sojourn by Alysdaire, Blackdawn were mysteriously ordered to make numerous preparations for what seemed to be an upcoming crisis.  With the assistance of 
				  Ander Carmyne's pirating, Morgan Ashford's assistance, and Taldrus Dawnfield (now a Marshal) forcing the Phantom Legion to surrender their larger weapons of war, Blackdawn was able to build a 
				  small fleet of four vessels: The Merchant Ship <em>Crownless</em>, The Pirate Frigate <em>Anderinlia</em>, the Medical Support Ship <em>Mercy</em> and the former Phantom Legion armored destroyer 
				  <em>VanCleef</em>, more appropriately renamed to <em>Silverlaine</em> under Blackdawn's banner.  In time, it was revealed that Alysdaire had seen terrible nightmares of sinking to the bottom 
				  of the sea amidst green flames, debris, and bodies while he had slept at the Shrine of Goldrinn during his sojourn.  Taking it as a sign from the Goddess Elune, Alysdaire had begun to prepare 
				  for what he believed was an inevitable battle, which soon came true with the assault on the Broken Shore.  It was due only to the naval expertise of Blackdawn's naval officers that the fleet 
				  survived, though their only undamaged ship that could still sail was the <em>Mercy</em>, the brain child of Reigan Ashford and Rosemary Dusklily.  As such, Blackdawn was once again limited to 
				  humanitarian efforts during the Legion Invasion, providing logistical and medical supply assistance to the war effort, with individual members of Blackdawn serving on the front lines in 
				  unofficial capacities.</p>
