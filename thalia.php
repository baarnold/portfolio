                    <h2 class="mk-4">Physical Appearance</h2>
                    <p>Standing at around five foot and eight inches, she was taller than most other women of average height around her; human women, 
					of course. Her lightly tanned skin did not carry too many scars or blemishes, none that were exposed at least, and it seemed to 
					match fairly well with her strawberry blonde hair. Said hair was pulled back into a tightly bound ponytail, which swayed and bobbed 
					with each and every movement from her head as it turned to scan her surroundings with those crimson eyes. Resting on the outside of 
					her right thigh would be a tattoo of the Scarlet flame, just as it is depicted on their tabards. As well, she had a singular piercing 
					which resided at her right nostril; a silver band. Nothing particularly special otherwise, in terms of decorating her body.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2 class="mk-4">Character History</h2>
                    <p>Thalia's history is about as blunt and to the point as she is sometimes. Her family was taken by the Scourge, she barely managed 
					to leave Stratholme in time, and she only wished to claim her homeland back from the undead that destroyed it. Naturally, the Scarlet 
					Crusade was a tempting offer, one which she easily fell for. She had already been reading and studying as a mage before joining, but 
					now the Crusade shaped her and she found herself an Invoker, specifically invoking the power of fire. She was studying in the Scarlet 
					Enclave, Tyr's Hand, when Acherus and the death knights arrived. It was here, as Abbendis left to form the Crimson Dawn, that she lost 
					her faith and left the order entirely. With the death knights pushing through Havenshire and New Avalon, she simply -left-, and made her 
					way south. She hasn't done much since then, and she's mainly kept to herself, simply choosing to remain within the walls of Stormwind.</p>
